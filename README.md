# An-Analysis-on-Lung-Cancer


ntroduction
Lung cancer is a significant public health concern, and understanding its various facets is crucial for both researchers and the general public. This project aims to contribute to the collective knowledge on lung cancer by conducting a detailed analysis of relevant data.

Dataset
The analysis is performed on a specific dataset, and details about the dataset can be found in the dataset directory. The dataset includes information about various factors such as patient demographics, smoking history, genetic markers, and more.

Analysis
The analysis covers a range of topics, including but not limited to:

Demographic Trends: Examining the distribution of lung cancer cases across different age groups, genders, and geographical locations.

Risk Factors: Investigating the impact of smoking history, environmental factors, and genetic predispositions on the likelihood of developing lung cancer.

Treatment Efficacy: Assessing the effectiveness of various treatments and interventions for lung cancer patients.

Findings
The results of the analysis are documented in the findings directory. This includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and any significant observations made during the analysis.
