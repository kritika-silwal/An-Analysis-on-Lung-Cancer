## Introduction

Lung cancer is a critical public health issue, and this project aims to contribute to the knowledge surrounding the disease. By analyzing relevant data, we seek to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights that can enhance our understanding of lung cancer and inform future research and interventions.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a specific dataset, and detailed information about the data can be found in the dataset directory. The dataset includes crucial information about patient demographics, smoking history, genetic markers, and other relevant factors.

## Analysis

The analysis is organized into different topics, each addressing specific aspects of lung cancer:

## Demographic Trends:

Explore the distribution of lung cancer cases across different age groups, genders, and geographical locations.

## Risk Factors:

Investigate the impact of smoking history, environmental factors, and genetic predispositions on the likelihood of developing lung cancer.

## Treatment Efficacy:

Assess the effectiveness of various treatments and interventions for lung cancer patients.

## Findings

The results of the analysis are documented in the findings directory. This includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and significant observations made during the analysis. Feel free to explore the findings to gain a deeper understanding of the insights derived from the data.
